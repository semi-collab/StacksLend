;; StacksLend: Decentralized Credit-Based Lending Protocol
;;
;; A Bitcoin-native microfinance protocol on Stacks that enables 
;; collateralized lending with dynamic interest rates and credit scoring.
;;
;; This contract allows users to:
;; - Build credit scores through consistent loan repayments
;; - Request loans with collateral requirements that decrease as credit improves
;; - Receive better interest rates as their credit score increases
;; - Build financial reputation in a decentralized manner
